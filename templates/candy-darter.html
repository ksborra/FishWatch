    <h3>How to help!!</h3>
    <h5>We can help the candy darter survive byâ€¦
    Dumping unused bait in the trash, rather than in the streams, to prevent the introduction of non-native species into areas where they may cause harm to the aquatic ecosystem.
    Planting trees and other native woody vegetation along streams to stabilize banks and help prevent erosion.
    Maintaining a buffer area with native trees and shrubs along streams to help control erosion and filter pollution and sediment before reaching the stream.
    Disposing of chemical waste products properly to prevent them from contaminating soils and polluting streams.
